Welcome to the **testing-features-on-git** repo! 👋

## 📋 What is this repo about?

This repository is a personal playground where I push my testing code and observe how it reacts on Git. It's a space for:

- 🚀 Experimenting with new code
- 🛠️ Trying out different features
- 🔄 Testing Git workflows and commands
- 📝 Learning and documenting results

Feel free to explore, break things, and learn! 😄
