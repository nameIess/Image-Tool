        Before submitting a **Bug Report**, please ensure the following:
        - You are running the latest version of the project.
        - You have your logs and relevant workflow on hand and will post them in this bug report.
        - You confirmed that the bug is not caused by a custom node or external modification.
        - This is an actual bug, not just a support question. A bug is when you can specify exact steps to replicate what went wrong and others will be able to repeat your steps and see the same issue happen.
        ## Very Important
        Please make sure that you post ALL your logs in the bug report. A bug report without logs will likely be ignored.
